Reduce Woo Commerce shopping cart abandonment by learning where your customers are dropping out of your sales funnel and optimizing for more sales.

== Description ==

Want to reduce abandoned carts on your Woo Commerce store?

I'd like to help you do that! Woo Flow will show you exactly where your Woo Commerce store is losing sales to abandoned carts and checkouts and help you learn how to fix your leaky sales funnel.

Did you realise:

*   Every online store suffers from cart abandonment.
*   My team has seen cart abandonment as high as 97%!
*   Most stores are losing around 68% of their sales to cart abandonment.
*   The biggest reason for customers abandoning their would-be purchases is not because they change their mind.

I'd really like to help you get a handle on your product, shopping cart and checkout abandonment. It might not be a big deal for your store but Woo Flow will help you put an exact, numerical figure on what your store is losing each month (or over whatever date range you like).

It couldn't be easier to setup the plugin. Just follow the installation instructions, allow it to collect some data over a few days/weeks/months and then you can build a picture of exactly where your store is losing the most sales...and the exact dollar value of the cost of those abandoned carts!

== Installation ==

How to install Woo Flow and start tracking your product, checkout and cart abandonment.
